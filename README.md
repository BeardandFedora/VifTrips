VifTrips
===========

A geospatialized Wordpress theme for managing maps and markers through trips.

This theme relies on the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) library for controlling the maps, and by default, 
uses [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) as tiles provider.

It's coded in HTML5 / CSS3, uses [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and is fully responsive for all devices.

## How It Works
Adds 3 custom content types:
* Trips : for grouping Maps and Posts into groups
* Maps : a map contains Markers
* Markers : markers belong to a Map and can contain a mix of text, image, audio or video.

> That's about it. The rest is a work in progress.
